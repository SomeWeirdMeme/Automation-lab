26.I have on.
27.Yes, the same pattern emerges.
28.to set all the values to 0 expect for the  middle one
29.look at code plsplpslpslslps
30.mission accomplished
31.If we change the next state to state the pattern goes diagonal and is not symetrical.
becaus it mixes up the old values with new ones
32.Yes, you can and you do so by clearing the old values 
so it can do the calculations it is an improvement to the previous code because is resources
are limited you it is the only way to do so.
33.in code
34.in code
35.there is 256 different ways not infinite or in java terms 255
36.problem with that is it goes outofBounds by hitting the edge and trying to calculate instead just make it so when it hits an
"edge" it assumes it is 0.
37.not sure how to answer this...
